# ProstuNet: Advancing Prostate Segmentation in 3D

ProstaVision is a project focused on 3D prostate segmentation using the UNet3D deep learning model. This README provides a brief overview of the project and its objectives.

### Project Overview
Prostate segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging, particularly in the field of prostate cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. This project aims to leverage the power of UNet3D, a specialized neural network architecture, to accurately segment 3D prostate images from the Prostate 3D dataset.

### Objectives
- Develop and train a UNet3D model for 3D prostate segmentation.
- Achieve a minimum Dice similarity coefficient of 0.7 on the test set.
- Provide a reliable tool for medical professionals to enhance prostate imaging and treatment planning.
